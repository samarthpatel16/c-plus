I found out thatwe should strcmp for string comparison. I used this function for validationof data in lab and DIY. I also learnt that we need to use delete keyword tofree any dynamically allocated memory. While using delete I faced an issuewhere if a dynamic variable is not initiated and we try to use delete to freememory than it might throw exception. Destructor is the correct place to usedelete keyword to free memory because it is always called when object isdestroyed by compiler. I also learnt how to fix the output format using setwand setprecision methods. By using fixed setprecision we can control thenumber of digits after decimal shown on screen and setw is used to setthe width a specific output will consume. By doing so we can set theformat of our output.I faced a lot of errors but the main error in which I spend most of the time to solve is the error regarding memory leakage. I do not free the dynamically allocated memory and due to this I was not able to submit the program. The putty was showing the error that states that my program was displaying the desired output but there was a problem of memory leakage in my program due to this I was not able to submit the workshop. I referred to the course notes and watched the recorded lectures. Finally I used delete keyword to free dynamically allocated memory.
